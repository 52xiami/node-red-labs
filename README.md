# Watson-Node-Red-examples

This Github project consists of a collection of examples on how to use the Watson nodes in Node-RED. Besides the samples there are some labs available where different Watson nodes are combined to create apps.
To use these nodes you first have to set up your environment. 
The information on this page will get you started in a few minutes. It helps you with

- setting up your environment
- build your first 'Hello World' flow
- additional information on the non-Watson Nodes you use in the labs

These Watson nodes are used:

- [Language Identification](watson_services_labs/language_identification/lab_language_identification.md)
- [Language Translation](watson_services_labs/language_translation/lab_language_translation.md)
- [Personality insights](watson_services_labs/personality_insights/lab_personality_insights.md)
