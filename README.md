# Watson-Node-Red-examples

This Github project consists of a collection of examples on how to use the Watson nodes in Node-RED. Besides the samples there are some labs available where different Watson nodes are combined to create apps.

To use these nodes you first have to set up your environment. 
The information on [this page](/node-RED_labs/README.md) will get you started in a few minutes. It helps you with:

- setting up your environment
- build your first 'Hello World' flow
- additional information on the non-Watson Nodes you use in the labs

In the image below you can see which Watson services are available in Bluemix. The circled ones are used in Node-RED.
Some nodes in Node-RED make use of the same service in Bluemix, like:
- The Language Identification and Language Translation nodes make use of the Language Translation service in Bluemix.  
- The Feature extract and image analysis nodes make use of the Alchemy API service in Bluemix

You can find different labs in this project:

- [Introduction to Node-RED](/node-RED_labs/README.md) (same link as above)
- [Introduction to the Watson nodes](/watson_services_labs/README.md)
- [Advanced labs](/watson_advanced_labs/README.md) where different nodes/services are combined
