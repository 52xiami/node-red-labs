#Speech to Text

Note: To use the Speech To Text node we ran into some restrictions, which will be solved soon. This is why this lab is based on a stand-alone system.

Speech to Text service can be used anywhere voice-interactivity is needed. The service is great for mobile experiences, transcribing media files, call center transcriptions, voice control of embedded systems, or converting sound to text to then make data searchable. Supported languages include:
- US English 
- Spanish 
- Japanese 
- Brazilian Portuguese
- Mandarin. 

To use the Speech To Text service in Node-RED you first need to make this service available in a way Node-RED can connect to that service. 

You need to have a local instance of Node-RED with IBM nodes available. If you don't have that yet, you can go [here](../../node-RED_labs/lab_node-RED.md).
Then go to the Bluemix catalog and go to the Speech to Text service and click on it. Make sure that there is no app bound to this service and click 'Use"
Wait until this service is deployed and click on 'Show Credentials', you will need the username and the password later on in this lab.

In this lab an audio file will be transcribed. This audiofile can be downloaded [here](Audio Message.wav). 
In the following screenshots you can see how the nodes are configured.

First you start with an Inject node, for starting the uploding of the .Wav file from your local machine into the Speech To Text service in Bluemix

The inject node is configured like this:

![`S2Tinject`](images/s2t_inject.jpg)

The next node is a File in node, which can read a local file. It is configured in the following way:

![`S2TFileIn`](images/s2t_FileIn.jpg)

Then the Speech to text node will be added. In the image below you can see how it is configured. You will need the credentials from the Bluemix service.

The last node is the Debug node. You need to configure this for getting the output in the debug window. The Speech to text node, will put the transcribed text into msg.transcription.

Then you need to wire all the nodes together and press on 'Deploy'

When you click on the Inject node, you will see the transcribed text from the audio file in the debug window.
