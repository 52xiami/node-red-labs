#Natural Language Classifier
**Note** For this exercise please check that your Bluemix region is set to US South

The Natural Language Classifier (NLC) is a service that can be trained and it 
is useful to describe how to create the steps to use it since it offers some cognitive learning features.

Overview of NLC -> [Overview](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/nl-classifier/)
 
Standard NLC Demo -> [Demo](http://natural-language-classifier-demo.mybluemix.net)

 Very useful API documentation which is sometimes hard to find -> [Useful API docs for curl, Node and Java](https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/?node#introduction)

##Creating and populating a NLC Service on Bluemix

Within Bluemix you can create an **unbound instance** of the NLC Service, by selecting Natural Language Classifier
in the Bluemix catalog.

![ScreenShot](images/nlc_std_service.png)

Click on the CREATE button to instantiate your unbound instance of the Natural Language Classifier service.

On the service description page click on the "Access the toolkit" button. 
![ScreenShot](images/nlc_access_toolkit.png)

Sign on to Bluemix to allow the toolkit to access your instance of the Natural Language Classifier.
![ScreenShot](images/nlc_toolkit_signon.png)

Confirm authorization for the toolkit access your instance.

Click on Training and then follow the steps as documented in [NLC toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/nl-classifier/tool_examples.shtml).  

Train the NLC Service with the sample CSV file.

You will need a Classifier ID, this can be obtained by clicking the Classifiers button and the Classifier ID is shown.

##Connecting to a existing NLC Service on Bluemix
 
In this lab we will assume (for now) that you have created a NLC Service in Bluemix and now wish to (a) check it's status and (b) ask it a question via calls in Node-RED.  We also assume you have created a Node-RED application using the Node-RED Starter Community boilerplate in Bluemix.

Open your Node-RED flow editor and drag/drop an two Inject nodes, two Function nodes, one http request node and one Debug node and join up as shown below  :
 
![ScreenShot](images/nlc_nodes_joined.png)

Notice the blue icons next to each node which indicates further configurations are needed on each node.

Double-click the top Inject node and select Blank from the option

![ScreenShot](images/nlc_inject_node.png)

Double-click the top Function node and enter the following code and name the node "get NLC status".  

NOTE : the NLC classifier ID has been hard coded in the request (msg.url="https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers/**D385B2-nlc-530**") just for speed - when the official Node-RED NLC nodes are created then there will be some other mechanism (to be decided) on how the NLC classifier ID is used/entered.  

    `msg.url="https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers/D385B2-nlc-530";`

![ScreenShot](images/nlc_get_status_function.png)

Go to Bluemix and open your application and navigate to the NLC Service.  Go to your NLC Service and click on Show Credentials - you have already carried this out in the section above and is just repeated here for reference.


![ScreenShot](images/nlc_credentials.png)

    {
      "natural_language_classifier": [
        {
          "name": "ibmwatson-nlc-classifier",
          "label": "natural_language_classifier",
          "plan": "standard",
          "credentials": {
            "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api",
            "username": "306c5772-63d0-40f4-b50d-4de334a00243",
            "password": "WHAT EVER YOUR PASSWORD IS"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

Make a note of the username and password values.  Double-click the HTTP Request node and enter your credentials for your NLC Service in the node 

![ScreenShot](images/nlc_credentials_request_node.png)

Click the Deploy button.

Click on the Inject node button and see if you are returned in the Debug Tab the reply that the NLC Service is available.

![ScreenShot](images/nlc_available.png)

Double-click the other Function node and paste the following code :

        msg.url="https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers/D385B2-nlc-530/classify?text=" + encodeURI(msg.payload);
    
![ScreenShot](images/nlc_ask_question.png)

Double-click the second Inject node and change the payload to String and enter the question "Is it hot ?"

![ScreenShot](images/nlc_inject_ask.png)

Click the Deploy button

Click the button of the Inject node and look at the contents of the Debug Tab

![ScreenShot](images/nlc_debug_ask_output.png)

##Using the NLC Service from Node-RED

Drag the Natural Language Classifier (NLC) node to the palette.  Double click and change the Properties to your username/password of the NLC Watson Service as documented above.
