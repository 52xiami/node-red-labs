# Watson Node-RED services labs

In this section, Watson services are highlighted. The labs will show you how you can use the services in Node-RED.
The labs will require that you have instances of the Watson services you need. For instructions on how to instantiate
and use the Watson services inside Node-RED follow this link.

- [Using Watson Servcies](using_watson_services/README.md)

NOTE : All the labs listed below assume that you have first created an Application from the Bluemix Node-RED Starter Boilerplate - see [here](../introduction_to_node_red/README.md) how to do that.
