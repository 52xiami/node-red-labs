#Document Conversion node for Node-RED
## Overview

The Document Conversion service provides an API that enables developers to transform a document into a new format. 
The input is a single PDF, Word, or HTML document and the output is an HTML document, a Text document, or Answer units 
that can be used with other Watson services: prepare documents for use with the Watson Retrieve and Rank Service.

In this example the Document Conversion node will take one document and convert it to plain HTML.
